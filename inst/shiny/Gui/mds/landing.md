Although weighted linear regression is well-established statistical methods, the `Test-and-Fit` strategy is still widely used for the selection of calibration curves and the weighting factors in bioanalytical community. With the `Test-and-Fit` strategy, an incorrect weighting factor can be easily selected because this strategy is based on the analystâ€™s subjective choice.

<b><span style="color:#F17F42">CCweights</span></b> is a web-based tool (also an R package) for automated assessment and selection of weighting factors for accurate quantification using linear calibration curve.

# Workflow

Below is an overview of CCWeights workflow:

<em>Figure 1. Schematic workflow of CCWeights</em>

**Data upload:** 

- Data must contain at least two columns, one is named as `Concentration`, one is named as `Response`. In case you have more than one compounds in your sample, you need to have a third column called `Compound`. If internal standards are used (e.g.. stable isotope labeled internal standards), please include another column named `IS`.
  
- You can refer to the example data in the **Upload Data** tab or **Figure 2** for the data format.
  
- You can also download the templates **[<b><span style="color:#F17F42">here</span></b>]()** to prepare your data accordingly.
